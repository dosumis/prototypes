remark: CVS revision number 1.21. Contains terms imported from GO revision: 1.3352, 23:07:2012 10:59, from CHEBI version 87, 05:01:2012 11:31 and from PATO - datestamp = 13:06:2011 11:15. Use of this ontology requires a reasoner. While this OBO file is the master edited version of fbbt, for most purposes it is better viewed and queried using the accompanying OWL version (fly_anatomy_XP.owl revision 1.6) and Protege 4.1+ or the OWL-API.  Recommended reasoners are FaCT++ and ELK.
